# Matrix
- A basic cpp code while describing matrix

## Theory
- A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers that are arranged in the form of rows and columns.
- In C++, a matrix is a so-called 2D array, with the dimensions as m,n, where m represents the number of rows present in the array, and n 
  represents the number of columns in the array.
- We can perform several operations on a matrix-like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, transposing of a matrix, and finding 
  the rank of a matrix.
